# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction - Regression Project

This project aims to predict the price of laptops based on their technical specifications using supervised machine learning regression models.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates laptop prices based on features such as processor type, RAM, storage, GPU, brand, screen size, and more.

## 📁 Files

- `Laptop Price Prediction - Regression.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Extracting and converting feature values (e.g., GB to numeric)
   - Encoding categorical variables (LabelEncoding / OneHotEncoding)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing price distribution
   - Correlation analysis
   - Feature relationships

3. **Model Building**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE

4. **Model Interpretation**
   - Feature importance
   - Error analysis
   - Overfitting vs. underfitting
